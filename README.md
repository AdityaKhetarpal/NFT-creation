# NFT-creation

Prerequisites

1.Set up a `Metamask` 

2.Check if your computer has `Node.js`.

To build the smart contract I used Hardhat.Hardhat is an Ethereum development environment and framework designed for full stack development. In simple words you can write your smart contract, deploy them, run tests, and debug your code.

To setup a Hardhat project, Open up a terminal and execute these commands :

`mkdir NFT`

`cd  NFT`

`npm init --yes`

`npm install --save-dev hardhat`

In the same directory where you installed Hardhat run:

`npx hardhat`

Select `Create a Javascript Project` and follow the steps. At the end, you will have a new Hardhat project ready to go!
